# Manchester City Football Club Website 

This project is a fan - made website dedicated to Manchester City Football Club.
It provides some information like a bit about their history and then about the club's top 5 current players along with some details which include : their names, pictures, height, position, nationality, and bit about their gameplay and what they all are best at. 
We built this website using 3 languages : HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The site aims to bring fans closer to the team with sleek, visually appealing layout and engaging content. Along with that, we tried to replicate the design of the team's official website.
